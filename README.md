What i have learnt:

1. Working with svgs - at first, i was unable to scale any of the svgs because they had an inline width inside the svg tag. After that, i had issues with sizing it as i had set the height and width to auto, and not by %.

2. semantic html - learnt that we should be using btn submit and not input type submit due to SEO reasons

- when styling a button in terms of background color, some white space may appear around it. To fix this, we will need to set a border to the button and give it that same background color.

3. learnt how to work with pseudo elements (before and after)
4. to make each child div have different width, i could just set the width to a % of the parent div (ie. resizing description text from 500px onward)

Some queries to address:

1. How do we ensure it is responsive for viewport height?

Stuff i did not implement:

1. hover states for the buttons - i will go through the previous difficulty exercises in frontend mentor first before coming back to this.
2. input validation for email - my focus is really to practice building responsive sites and get out of tutorial hell for now
